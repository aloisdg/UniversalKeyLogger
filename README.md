# UniversalKeyLogger

This tool is made for the study of typing habit, with the goal to analyze it to create a personalized keyboard layout (see [my work on that](https://github.com/blalande/KeyboardLayoutMaker))

One thing I found about other key logger is that most of the time they log the key, not the character displayed. That works well for QWERTY layout, but I’m using [BÉPO](http://bepo.fr/wiki/Accueil) and I couldn’t get a good stats.

Also as I don’t wan’t to install a spyware on my machine I had to go open source :)

Hope you enjoy
